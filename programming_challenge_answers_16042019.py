# Programming challenge 1

# The program asks the user for a car make,
# model and daily rate 1 then displays a table
# of daily charges for between one and fourteen days.
make = input("Enter make")
model = input("Enter model")
dailyrate = int(input("Enter daily rate"))

if (make.lower() == "fiat"):
    print("You have a free atlas")

# Programming challenge 2

# You are required to write a program to count the
# number of pupils in a class of twelve who score over
# 40 in a test out of 60.  The pupilsâ€™ marks are to be
# entered at the keyboard.  The output is a message that
# indicates the number of pupils who score more than 40.
